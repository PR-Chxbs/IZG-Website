        <section class="description">
            <p>At Izandla Ziya Gezana, we believe in giving with purpose and receiving with dignity. Our name, which means "hands wash each other" in isiZulu, truly reflects our mission; to lift up one another, with one act of kindness at a time.</p>
            <p>We are a community-driven non-profit organisation focused on supporting students from underprivileged backgrounds with the essential hygiene and food products they need to get through the school day with confidence and dignity. Our current focus is on girls, providing crucial sanitary products like pads and toiletries; because no student should miss school due to something so basic.</p>
            <p>As we grow, our helping hands will stretch wider, reaching out to support students of all genders, because dignity has no gender, and every young person deserves to thrive. </p>
            <p><b>Important Notice! We do not accept money.</b> We encourage contributions of products, the tangible things that will be passed straight to those who need them. Products like sanitary pads, soap, non-perishable foods, etc.; the day-to-day things that many take for granted.</p>
            <p>We are also open to collaboration. Whether you are part of an orphanage, school, or another orphanage that shares the same vision, we would love to work together. The more hands involved, the more change we can make.</p>
            <p>At Izandla Ziya Gezana, we don't just give; we care, we connect, and we uplift. </p>
            <h3 class="quote">Together, hand in hand, we build a future where nobody is left behind.</h3>
